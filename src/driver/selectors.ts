/**
 * All DOM selectors for the Gemini web app live here, and nowhere else.
 * Google changes this UI without notice, so when the driver stops working
 * this is the first (and hopefully only) file you need to touch.
 *
 * HOW TO (RE)CALIBRATE THESE:
 *   1. Log in once via `npm run login` (uses the same persistent profile
 *      this driver uses, so cookies carry over).
 *   2. In another terminal, run Playwright's own inspector against that
 *      profile so you can click elements and have it print selectors:
 *
 *        npx playwright codegen \
 *          --user-data-dir ./.gemini-code-profile \
 *          https://gemini.google.com/app
 *
 *   3. Click the prompt box, the send button, a "stop generating" button
 *      (mid-response), and a finished response bubble. Copy the selectors
 *      codegen prints into the fields below.
 *
 * WHY THESE USE ^= (starts-with) AND NOT *= (contains):
 *
 * Gemini renders a "More options for <the entire message text>" button for
 * every message in the thread — the whole prompt ends up inside that
 * button's aria-label. So `button[aria-label*="Send" i]` matched those
 * buttons for any conversation containing the word "send" (our own primer
 * says "After you send a tool call"), they sort earlier in the DOM than the
 * real control, and `.first()` clicked a hidden one. The send silently did
 * nothing, and only after a few turns — which is why it looked intermittent.
 * Anchor on the start of the label, and always filter to visible.
 *
 * The selectors here are best-effort placeholders based on the app's
 * general structure (rich-text composer, Angular Material buttons) — they
 * are NOT guaranteed to match the live DOM. Treat them as a starting point.
